# K8s helm charts

## LAB Overview

#### In this lab you are going to work with helm charts

## Task 1: Search and install existin helm charts

1. Install helm: 
   https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v3.0.1
2. List all helm charts that are available in helm hub (https://hub.helm.sh): 
    `helm search hub`
3. Search for wordpress in helm hub:
   `helm search hub wordpress`

   You will see that there are three different wordpress charts in three different repositories.
4. Add bitnami repository to local repo: `helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami`
5. List of charts that are in your local repo: `helm search repo`
6. Search for wordpress chart in your local repo: `helm search repo wordpress`
7. Install wordpress helm chart: `helm install bitnami/wordpress --generate-name`
8. Monitor deployment creation (`kubectl get deployment`) and follow instructions in termimal.
9. Get wordpress external ip: `kubectl get svc` and open wordpress in a browser.
10. List all helm releases: `helm list`
11. Delete the wordpress release: `helm delete <-wordpress release name->`

## Task 2: Create your own helm chart
In this task you are going to create your own helm chart.
1. Run: `helm create mychart`. This command will create new directory "mychart". Explore it.
2. Take a look on templating engine. Open `templates/service.yaml` and see how template is defined, how "Chart.yaml" and "values.yaml" are combined.
3. Explore what will be the final yaml generated from template: `helm install --dry-run --debug --generate-name ./mychart`. This command does a dry-run so in fact nothing happed.
4. Take a look and note which port is defined in resulting Service object.
5. Open `values.yaml` and change `service.port` field to `81`
6. Execute `helm install --dry-run --debug --generate-name ./mychart` again and see that service port number has changed.
7. Open `values.yaml` and  back `service.port` field to `80`

## Task 3: Deploy your own helm chart
Generated helm chart deploys nginx in as a ClusterIP service which is accessible only within the cluster. Let's deploy our solution but change service type to LoadBalancer.

1. Open `value.yaml`
2. Change `service.type` to `LoadBalancer`
3. Change `image.repository` to `prydonius/todo`
4. Open `Chart.yaml` and change `AppVersion` to `1.0.0`. This value is used as a tag for the docker image.
5. Validate your charts with linter: `helm lint ./mychart`
6. Install your solution: `helm install mytodoapp ./mychart`
7. Wait for the deployment to finish and grab the service ip: `kubectl get svc` 
8. Run a TODO app in a browser.
9. You can also make a package from your helm dir: `helm package ./mychart`.
10. Delete the release (`helm list`, `helm delete <-release->`)
