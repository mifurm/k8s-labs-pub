# ReplicaSet

## LAB Overview

#### In this lab you will work with a ReplicaSet

## Task 1: Creating a ReplicaSet 

1. Create new file by typing ``nano rs.yaml``.
2. Download [manifest file](./files/rs.yaml) and paste its content into editor.
3. Save changes by pressing *CTRL+O* and *CTRL-X*.
4. Type ``kubectl create -f rs.yaml`` and press enter.
5. Check if there is a pod created by typing ``kubectl get pods``.

## Task 2: Inspecting ReplicaSet and its behaviour

1. Execute following command:
``
kubectl describe rs frontend
``
![img](./img/replicaset2.png)
You can see the label selector for the ReplicaSet, as well as the state of all of the replicas managed by the ReplicaSet.

2. Once again get a list of pods inside the replica ``kubectl get pods -l app=frontend``
3. Execute the following command ``kubectl delete pod <POD-NAME>`` but replace *<POD-NAME>* with one of the pod's name, i.e.: ``kubectl delete pod frontend-z5bwf``.
3. Get a list of pods ``kubectl get pods -l app=frontend``

As you can see, ReplicaSet still have 3 running pods.

## Task 3: Scaling ReplicaSet

You can scale ReplicaSet using declarative way by changing manifest file. But you can also do it imperative way.

1. Execute following command:
``
kubectl scale replicaset frontend --replicas=5
``
2. Get a list of pods `kubectl get pods -l app=frontend`
![img](./img/replicaset4.png)
Now you should have 5 pods running inside ReplicaSet.

## Task 4: Detach replica set from pods
1. You can delete replica set without deleting the pods. Execute: `kubectl delete rs frontend --cascade=false`
2. Run: `kubectl get pods -l app=frontend` and see that there are still 5 pods created by replica set.
3. Delete one of the pod: `kubectl delete pod POD_NAME`. This pod won't be recreated so there will be 4 pods left. Verify it: `kubectl get pods -l app=frontend`
4. Create the replica set again: `kubectl create -f rs.yaml`. 
5. Now all 4 pods will be again managed by replica set. In .yaml definition there are 3 replicas so one pod will be deleted. Execute: `kubectl get pods -l app=frontend`
6. Delete the replicaset by executing following command:
`
kubectl delete rs frontend
`
7. Now all the pods managed by replica set should be deleted.
